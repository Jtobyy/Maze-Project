# Maze-Project

## Description
Maze-Project is a game developed in C Programming and SDL2. The Maze-Project implements walls,3D orientations, moves, textures, rotation, and collisions.

## How to install and run the Maze-Project
- First download the SDL installation script from
[sdl2 installation script](//s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/graphics_programming/install_SDL2.sh)
- Then run the script

### Alternatively launch the installation with one command like follows:
curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/graphics_programming/install_SDL2.sh | sudo bash

## Working with WSL2?
After installation, make sure you're able to run Linux GUI applications
- You have a X server for windows installed. If you don't, I recommend [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)
- Bash is configured to use the local X server
`export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0`
